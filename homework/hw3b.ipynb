    "This assignment transitions you from NumPy's numerical array operations to Pandas' powerful tabular data manipulation. While NumPy excels at homogeneous numerical arrays, Pandas is designed for the heterogeneous, labeled data that characterizes most real-world datasets—mixing dates, categories, numbers, and text within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with real bike share data from Chicago's Divvy system to answer questions about urban transportation patterns. Through three progressively complex problems—exploring usage patterns, analyzing rider behavior, and conducting temporal analysis—you'll discover why Pandas has become the standard tool for data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment emphasizes Pandas' design philosophy: named column access, explicit indexing methods (loc/iloc), handling missing data, and method chaining for readable data pipelines. You'll also see how Pandas builds on NumPy while adding the structure and convenience needed for practical data science work.\n",

    "Pandas assigned `object` types to both `started_at` and `member_casual` in task 2a. Now, this constitutes problem because we don't know what is the actualy data type in those columns. Also, for datetime set as an object, we cannot do any operations such as, subtracting, resampling etc., on it. Setting `member_casual` as an object takes up more memory even though it has only two values, for a dataset large enough, this can slow down the actions. \n",

    "Git commit IDs are derived from the commit’s entire content and context. It is more like a fingerprint for a particular commit than a serial number, as it includes its parents hash. I don't think the station IDs here aren’t completely cryptographic hashes like git commit IDs. Rather, they work as identifiers assigned to each stations so every ride can point to their respective station. I have also found some IDs are straight up numbers instead of crypotographic expressions and missing values assigned to some observations in the dataset. They’re maybe not derived from the station’s full characteristic, but might be based on the stations name and/or its location.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3\n",
    "Method chaining is the way of calling one method right after another on the same object so the output of one becomes the input to the next. `df.isna()` assesses each value in the dataset on each column to check whether there is a missing value or not and then assigns eithe True/False to that position. Here in `Pandas`, the boolean values are treated as 1 for True and 0 for False. Then, using the `.sum()` method adds up the number of Trues in each column and gives us the total count of missing values each column has.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4\n",
    "If about 10% of the station name or ID columns are missing but the location coordinates (lat/long) columns are almost complete, a possible explanation could be that the rider recorded their stating and ending coordinates, but the system couldn’t match these to station IDs or names. In that case, I think it would be better to not flag those row as bad data and remove them. Obviously we cannot use those rows for say a station-based analysis and interpretation, but for other analyses we can use the data in those rows. Whenever we are doing a staion-based analysis we can just filter the missing value rows and keep them outside of the scope of the analysis. We can also use the coordinates (since almost ~0% are missing) to find a way to generate a station name or ID."

For this reason why the memory usage dropped in the latter case.  \n",

Before exporing the `.csv` file of the sampled data we wanted `started_at` to appear as an actual column in the CSV. If we had exported the data while the` started_at` was still as the index and used `index=False`, the index wouldn’t be written at all. So, we would lose the datetime information in the exported file. Resetting index moves the `started_at` back into the columns, then we can safely do `index=False` and keep the timestamps."

    "Putting the whole chain in parentheses and putting each method on its own line makes it way easier to read because then we can scan it top-to-bottom in an explicit chain. Debugging also becomes easier if this style used. We can temporarily comment out one line in the middle for checking where the issue is and then subsequently come up with proper solution to the problem. It also makes diffs in git cleaner, if I add or change one step, only that line shows up in the diff instead of one giant line. The downside of heavy chaining is that it can hide messy logic that would be clearer if it were split it into 2–3 steps. Also, if something went wrong in the middle of the chain, it would take some time to point out the real location of the issue.\n",

    "When I loaded the `.csv` file earlier without using `parse_dates=`, `Pandas` treated the datetime columns like as objects instead of assigning them their real type; similar thing happened to the categorical columns, they were also declared as objects. But, the `pickle` version kept the original dtypes for the columns and did not convert them to an `object` data-type. This become important because with the `pickled` version, I can immediately do time-based filtering, .dt.hour, groupby operations. Moreover, I don’t have to re-specify dtypes every time you load the file (which is a slight relief, I guess!).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3\n",
    "The `pickle` version would be great for my own workflow. It is faster to load, smaller in size, and preserves all the data-types. It is also perfect for iterative analysis in the same environment. `.csv` is better when I need portability and transparency meaning that any tool can open it, it’s human-readable, and it’s safer for sharing or long-term storage."

    "The big shift is that with `NumPy` we think in terms of positions (i.e., row 0, col 1) on a purely numeric array, but with `Pandas` we think in terms of labels and columns with meaning. A dataframe isn’t just numbers, each column can have a name, a different type, etc., and `Pandas` line things up by these labels. It means that I can select by column name, work with dates, and handle missing data. So the mindset changes from \"arrays of numbers\" to \"tables of labeled data\" (I've borrowed this line from the web because it sounds nice and appropriate one-liner!!).\n",

    "Working with the real CSV was a bit messier than hw2b. Here, columns had different types (strings, dates, categories), some values were missing. Also timestamps were loaded as object that had to be parsed to revert it back to original data type, similar thing with the categorical values too. With the NumPy arrays, everything was already clean, numeric, same shape, and I just performed operations on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Pandas` understand columns with names, mixed dtypes, missing data, and time indexes. It provides ways of handling missing data, assigning appropriate data types (if necessary), filtering data by labels, group by categories, resample, and export to CSV or Excel spreadsheets. These characteristics make `Pandas` a great framework for data analysis.\n",

    "Well, although I had some notions about the stuffs that we've used in this homework, I have learnt about how to assign appropriate data types, `groupby` actions, how to re-index, how to use `query`, and lastly the `pickle` version of loading data. These will help me a lot in working with my own data. Also, i have learnt about how these things work by writing answers to the reflection questions which has helped me to get a better understanding of what I'm actually doing.  \n",
    "I would say a solid 7.5 on using `Pandas` for my own projects. I don't want repeat the same talk again and again, but with the variety of operations that `Pandas` offer, it will be much more helpful platform to load, handle, and analyze real-life datasets. My current score (a whopping 7.5 out 10!!!) will eventually get better with more and more experience with messy, messier, and messiest datasets (hopefully). (xD)\n",
